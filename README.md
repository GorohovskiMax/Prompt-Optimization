# Prompt Engineering Mini-Project: Explaining Gradient Descent to Different Audiences

This project demonstrates the power of **prompt engineering** through a practical exercise in **audience adaptation**.  
The objective was to craft targeted prompts for explaining the concept of **gradient descent** using a language model (ChatGPT o4), with each prompt tailored to a distinct type of reader:

- 🧒 A child (~10 years old)
- 🎓 A first-year university data science student
- 👨‍💻 A machine learning-savvy software engineer

By varying the language, structure, and depth of the prompts, we observe how the model adapts its output accordingly.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Showcase the **importance of context framing** and prompt design when working with large language models (LLMs)
- Compare how **the same core concept** (gradient descent) can be communicated effectively in different styles
- Evaluate and reflect on prompt quality, audience fit, and output clarity

## 🛠️ Methodology

1. **Three unique prompts** were written for three distinct personas, specifying role, tone, and structure.
2. Each prompt was run through **ChatGPT o4** model, generating a response in natural language.
3. The responses were saved and reviewed.
4. An **evaluation file** summarizes what worked well and how prompt structure affected the generated content.
