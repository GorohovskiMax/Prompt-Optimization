Certainly! Here's an explanation tailored for a **software engineer with ML experience**, structured clearly into three parts as requested:

### ‚öôÔ∏è How Gradient Descent Works

Gradient descent is an **iterative optimization algorithm** used to minimize a loss function by updating parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient.
At each iteration $t$, we update weights $\theta$ as:

$$
\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \alpha \cdot \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(\theta_t)
$$

where:

* $\alpha$ is the **learning rate**
* $\nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}$ is the gradient of the loss with respect to the parameters

This process continues until convergence ‚Äî ideally reaching a local (or global) minimum of the loss surface.

### üß± Limitations of Basic Gradient Descent

1. **Sensitivity to Learning Rate**:

   * Too large ‚Üí divergence
   * Too small ‚Üí painfully slow convergence

2. **Poor Conditioning / Saddle Points**:

   * Gets stuck in flat regions or saddle points
   * Struggles with very "bumpy" loss surfaces

3. **No Adaptivity**:

   * Applies the same learning rate across all parameters, regardless of curvature or gradient scale

4. **Mini-batch Noisiness**:

   * In stochastic or mini-batch settings, noisy gradients can make convergence unstable

### üß† When to Use Other Optimizers like Adam

Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) extends SGD by maintaining moving averages of both the gradients and their squared values, which helps in the following ways:

‚úÖ **Adaptive Learning Rates** per parameter
‚úÖ **Faster convergence** on sparse or noisy gradients
‚úÖ **Works well out of the box** for many deep learning problems

You might prefer **Adam over SGD** when:

* Training **deep neural networks** (especially with many parameters)
* Dealing with **sparse features** (e.g., in NLP)
* You want **faster convergence** without much hyperparameter tuning

However, Adam may generalize slightly worse than SGD in some cases, especially in computer vision ‚Äî so some practitioners still prefer SGD with momentum when they can afford longer training.
